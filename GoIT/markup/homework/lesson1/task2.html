    The Hanseatic League had bee</p>

<p>n officially formed at LГјbeck on the sea coast of Northern Germany in 1356. The Hanseatic League sought civil and
    commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.
    In exchange they offered a certain amount of protection. Having their own navy the Hansa were able to sweep the
    Baltic Sea free of pirates. The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would
    be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They also sought agreement to be free of all customs and
    taxes. With these concessions, LГјbeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, Sweden and soon came to dominate the economic
    life of that city and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.
    Under the Hanseatic trade 2/3 of Stockholm's imports consisted of textiles and 1/3 of salt. Exports from Sweden
    consisted of iron and copper.During the 17th century Sweden emerged as a European great power. Before the emergence
    of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a very poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilization,
    with no significant power or reputation.</p>

Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and PolandвЂ“Lithuania in multiple conflicts, including the Thirty Years' War.In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes on the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism. In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with both sides competing for territories of today's Baltic states, with the disastrous Battle of Kircholm being one of the highlights. One-third of the Finnish population died in the devastating famine that struck the country in 1696. Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population.

The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the Deluge. After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles' son, Charles XI, to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden Charles XII, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.</p>

<p>After the Battle of Narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the Great Northern War, the Russian army was so severely decimated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia. However, Charles did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland-Lithuania and defeating the Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702. This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernize its army.
    After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an invasion attempt of Russia which ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Marten%27s_Poltava.jpg/800px-Marten%27s_Poltava.jpg" alt="Fifth picture." align="left" width="700"height="500" vspace="5" hspace="5">After a long march exposed to cossack raids, Russian Tsar Peter the Great's scorched-earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of 1709, the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire.After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an invasion attempt of Russia which ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.

<p>There was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries, which the writer Esaias TegnГ©r in 1833 attributed to "peace, vaccine, and potatoes".Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialize
    Many looked towards America for a better life during this time. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Farewell_to_home%2C_G%C3%B6teborg%2C_1905.jpg" alt="Sixth picture" align="right" width="700"height="500" vspace="5" hspace="5">It is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States.In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city). Most Swedish immigrants moved to the Midwestern United States, with a large population in Minnesota, with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada.
    Despite the slow rate of industrialization into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy because of innovations and the large population growth.These innovations included government-sponsored programs of enclosure, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato.Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialized economy that exists today.Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the Industrial Revolution progressed during the 20th century, people gradually began moving into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of parliamentarism, and the country saw comprehensive democratic reforms under the joint Liberal-Social Democrat cabinet of Nils EdГ©n and Hjalmar Branting, with universal and equal suffrage to both houses of parliament enacted for men in 1918 and for women in 1919. The reforms were widely accepted by King Gustaf V, who had previously ousted Karl Staaff's elected Liberal government in the Courtyard Crisis because of differences in defence policy. It is possible that the Monarchy of Sweden survived because of the breakout of World War One, which saw a major shift in public sentiment towards the king's more pro-military views.</p>
